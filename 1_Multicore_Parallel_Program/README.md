# Lemoine's Conjecture
Sequential and Parallel Programs to verify Lemoine's Conjecture for all odd integers in a given range.

The Conjecture states that 
```
Every odd integer greater than 5 is the sum of a prime and twice a prime.

```
In other words, if n is odd and n > 5, then n = p + 2q for some primes p and q. The primes p and q might or might not be the same.
